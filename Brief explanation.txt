Brief explanation
I have added two event listeners to the "view details" button at the bottom of the "Tips for expo participant" and "Ticket selling" modules on the home page. I have added an event listener to the "view details" button at the bottom of the "Tips for expo participant" and "Ticket selling" modules on the homepage, because the main possible sources of revenue for my website are ticket revenue and soft advertising with partners. The tickets are placed on the "Ticket selling" page, while the softlines are mainly placed on the "Tips for expo participants" page. By setting event listener on these two buttons, I want to know which page the user prefers to click on.
